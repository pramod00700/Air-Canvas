# Air-Canvas
Project based on python and open cv
Application where you can draw or paint on screen using a camera that tracks your hand movements in air. 
By harnessing the power of Python, technologies like Tkinter and OpenCV, Air Canvas provides a touchless and intuitive solution for seamless writing and erasing experiences.
This system allows us to write/draw on a canvas or an already existing file(pdf,ppt),basically we can annotate an already exixting file.
Key component of the project are 1)Hand Gestures  2)Modes(writing,erasing,saving,selection)
There is dedicated hand gesture for each mode  
          1)Index finger up -writing mode
          2) Index+middle finger up - selection mode(selecting marker color,eraser)
          3) Little fingre +index finger up-  for saving a document
This is command line based application.
To run it on a device we need to have a python IDE and dependencies given in requirement.txt file 
Once the program is launched we can chose to write on new canvas or on an existing file usig differnt hand gestures, and save our work.
To start project we run myui.py file.
To close application we press 'q'.
